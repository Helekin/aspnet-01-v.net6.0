        <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
        <p>APassionate about programming, I have a strong background in various programming languages, including C#,
            JavaScript, PHP, Node.js, Java, and C++. Additionally, I am well-versed in web technologies such as HTML,
            CSS, and Bootstrap, enabling me to create attractive and functional user interfaces.</p>
        <p>My expertise extends beyond front-end development, encompassing both relational databases like MySQL and SQL
            Server, and non-relational databases like MongoDB. This versatility has allowed me to tackle diverse and
            challenging projects, providing efficient and effective solutions.</p>
        <p>I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to apply my technical and creative skills. If
            you are seeking someone who brings experience and passion to the team, I would be delighted to connect with
            you.</p>
